# Vehicle-management-system

This is a DBMS project for managing vehicles in a parking system.

Pre-requisites--> download XAMP server , start it, you will see a control panel open up there go to MySQL and click on start.
(this could be done any other server which supports MySQL such as WAMP server)

Then just download the database from this path "Database/parking1.sql"

This SQL file can then be imported into the server.

Then go to the browser and write "http://localhost/parking1/admin_login.php".

Then it should work.
